# nForms

> _WORK IN PROGRESS_

The goal of this project is to create a form-building service that allows users to easily create embeddable forms that can be integrated into any website, with submitted data intended to be processed using NLP techniques such as sentiment analysis or keyword extraction.

## Running

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

2. Start required services with Docker

```bash
docker compose up
```

3. In a new terminal window or tab, run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application should now be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
